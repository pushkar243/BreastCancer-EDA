# BreastCancer-EDA
Dataset is present in Kaggle at the location : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/breast-cancer-dataset .
**Objective** : Breast cancer is one of the most prevalent forms of cancer among women globally. Early and accurate diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment. Machine learning algorithms can play a significant role in assisting medical professionals in this regard. In this project, we aim to build and compare the performance of Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithms to predict the presence or absence of malignant breast cancer using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset.

**Approach** :

1. Data visualizations to get an insight about the dataset.

2.Correlational analysis on the dataset. Provide a visualization for the same.

3.Do the appropriate pre-processing of the data like identifying NULL or Missing Values if any, handling of outliers if present in the dataset, skewed data, etc. Mention the pre-processing steps performed in the markdown cell. 

4.Apply appropriate feature engineering techniques for them. Apply the feature transformation techniques like Standardization, Normalization, etc. for identifying feature importance for your feature engineering task.

5.Split the data into train and test dataset.Train = 80 % Test = 20%

6.Build a KNN and Random Forest classification model to predict the presence or absence of breast cancer.

7.Tune hyperparameters (e.g., number of trees, maximum depth) using cross-validation.

8.Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
